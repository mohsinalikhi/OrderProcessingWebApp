# OrderProcessingWebApp
Project Assignment: ASP.NET Order Processing Application 

Objective: 
Develop a small, functional ASP.NET web application that implements business logic for processing customer orders. 
This assignment is designed to assess your ability to understand business logic, write clean and efficient code, 
and use modern development tools like GitHub and CI/CD pipelines. 

Business Scenario: 
Build a simple order processing system where customers can enter an order amount and select their customer type ("New" or "Loyal"). The application should calculate a discount based on the following logic: 
- If the order amount is $100 or more and the customer is "Loyal", apply a 10% discount. 
- Otherwise, no discount is applied. 

Display the calculated discount and the final order total on a results page. 

Technical Requirements: 

1.	ASP.NET Application: 
a. Develop the application using ASP.NET MVC. 
b. Implement a clean, user-friendly interface with at least two views: one for order entry and one for displaying results. 

2.	Business Logic: 
a. Accurately implement the discount logic as described above. 
b. Ensure the calculation is robust and handles edge cases (e.g., exactly $100, invalid inputs).
